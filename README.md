# Grandpa Library
The script is downloading book covers and books from [the website](https://tululu.org) as txt file and shows on the terminal authors, titles , a genre and reviews.
## Installation.
Install Python3 latest version. Install PyCharm IDE, if you need it.
> To isolate the project, I'd recommend to use a virtual environment model. [vertualenv/venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
 ## Preparing to run the script.
+ Create a virtualenv and activate it.
+ Then use pip (or pip3, there is a conflict with Python2) to install the dependencies (use the requirements.txt file):
```bash
% pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Run the script.
User need to specify books interval by command:
```python
python3 main.py 20 30
```
